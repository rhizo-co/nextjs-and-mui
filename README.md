# Next.js and MUI Template / Demo

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project with [MUI](https://mui.com)

## Getting Started (Development)

### Replit

In Replit just hit run!

### Everywhere else

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Editing

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.


## TODO

Stuff that is not yet done in this template / demo:

### API Routes

Add an [API route](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction)

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as API Routes instead of React pages.
